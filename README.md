# Problem Statements
1: 
Python code to plot UnDirected graph, Directed graph and Mixed graph from its adjacency matrix.<br/>
U tube link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y186GaNNZBQ

2:
Train a system to recognize 5 English characters. Recognize how often the trained characters are present and locate them.<br/>
(Trained and tested on different font styles)

3: 
Let intersection operation of graphs G1 and G2 is defined as G1 Õˆ G2. <br/>
Demonstrate for : <br/>
* Empty/NullConnected graph,
* Disconnected graph
* Resultant is an original graph.

4:
Given G(n,e) <br/>
* Extract all possible Hamiltonian circuits and edge disjoint Hamiltonian circuits, if G(n, e) is Hamiltonian else extract Hamiltonian path.<br/>
* If edges are weighted, then extract the least cost Hamiltonian circuit (or Hamiltonian path).<br/>
Validate the circuits if G is directed.
